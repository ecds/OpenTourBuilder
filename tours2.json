It is a means of engaging with the recorded past and the remembered past of a particularly fierce fight between North and South on July 22, 1864. The fighting that day was the biggest battle fought in the final 10 months of the Civil War, and the Federal victory set the stage for the siege of the Atlanta that followed and the city&rsquo;s eventual fall to the Union Army on September 2, 1864. The famous Atlanta Cyclorama painting depicts a Yankee attack against the Confederate forces defending the city at approximately 4:30 p.m. on the day of the battle. This site combines a narrative of battlefield events with images from the Cyclorama and other visual and textual artifacts into a digital tour guide with contextual links. Although the tour guide is designed to inform a trip to battlefield sites by car or bus&mdash;a tour map, recommended route, and sequence of stops are included&mdash;the tour information and links to additional materials also can be used to learn about the Battle of Atlanta without an actual visit to what remains of the battlefield. This site presupposes no prior knowledge of Atlanta and the Civil War, and it is intended for a variety of users and uses. Much of the supporting materials are drawn from Emory University&rsquo;s MARBL collection . . .</p>\r\n<p>Northern Civil War commanders made capture of Southern cities, specifically Atlanta and Richmond, a major goal in the military campaigns that began in May 1864. Atlanta became a target because of its unique political, economic, and psychological importance to the Confederacy. Atlanta was a vital source of material support for the war effort and a bastion of hope for the South as its military fortunes waned. The city&rsquo;s fiery destruction in November 1864 and the battles and siege that preceded its ruin are an indelible part of Civil War history and lore. The events in and around Atlanta are part of a violent past that over time, and in a variety of ways, have triggered a cultural struggle over the war&rsquo;s meaning. Different versions of what is remembered, or even what is worth remembering, have been expressed in private and public forms that have their own history. These memories of the past deserve as much attention as the basic facts of the battles themselves because the memory versions often exert a far greater impact. For example, many more people have been influenced by a Civil War drama set in Atlanta and its environs, namely Margaret Mitchell&rsquo;s Gone with the Wind, than have read the works of all professional Civil War historians combined. The evocative power of Atlanta and the Civil War endures. It is evident in iconic images and texts, commemorative rituals, monuments, and other forms of remembrance that warrant further investigation along with the physical remnants of the battlefields, which even today are accessible with the aid of maps and historic markers.</p>\r\n<p>The absence of a historically preserved battlefield is both a challenge to visitors and an opportunity. Visitors seeking firsthand knowledge about the places and events that figured prominently in the Battle of Atlanta are obligated to go beyond the almost effortless engagement with history that is available at famously well-preserved Civil War battle sites, such as Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Their visits to the Atlanta battlefield, even if by means of a virtual tour, call for greater self-reliance and a more active process of combining historical accounts, maps, and images with present day visual evidence to ferret out what happened, where, and why, on July 22, 1864. The rewards are great. By juxtaposing information from then and now visitors traveling through contemporary Atlanta gain a new and powerful perspective on the city, its neighborhoods, and their place in history. Physical traces of the Battle of Atlanta evoke insights and exchanges that go beyond the battlefield and touch on broader questions about the Civil War, its causes and consequences, and the historical memory of major battles and the generals and soldiers who fought them. The fact that slaves were bought and sold in Atlanta and were used to build walled fortifications around the city in a failed effort to defend it from the Federal attack raises questions about slavery's role in causing, perpetuating, and eventually ending the war. The implications of the fight for Atlanta occurring in the midst of a wartime Presidential election campaign in the North highlights the connection between war and politics and the ways in which the outcome of a single, hard fought battle can extend its effects well beyond the immediate military contest to civil society and regional and national history. The legacy of the Battle of Atlanta lived on, and battlefield monuments to two fallen generals, one Southern and one Northern, became focal points for Civil War commemoration and serve as reminders, even today, of how contested the memory of the war can be.</p>"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 1, "tour": 1, "info_slug": "instructions", "name": "Instructions", "description": "<p>Here are some instructions!</p>"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 2, "tour": 1, "info_slug": "companion-article", "name": "Companion Article", "description": "<p>You can read the companion article to the Battle of Atlanta tour at <a href=\"http://southernspaces.org/\">Southern Spaces</a>.</p>"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 0, "tour": 4, "info_slug": "instructions-2", "name": "Instructions", "description": "<p>blerch</p>"}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 1, "tour": 4, "info_slug": "one-hundred-and-one-dalmations", "name": "One Hundred and One Dalmations", "description": "<p>Spots!</p>"}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 0, "tour": 9, "info_slug": "the-ritz-carlton", "name": "The Ritz Carlton", "description": "<p>Monkey</p>"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "tour.tourinfo", "fields": {"position": 1, "tour": 9, "info_slug": "emory-village", "name": "Emory Village", "description": "<p>Just don't do it after 10pm</p>"}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "tour.tourstop", "fields": {"park_lng": -84.331818, "park_lat": 33.747579, "name": "Where the Battle Begins", "article_link": "", "directions_intro": "", "lat": 33.7471734546, "tour": 1, "parking_block": "", "video_embed": "", "position": 5, "lng": -84.3314568512, "metadescription": "Alonzo Crim High School: The site where, on July 22, 1864, two Confederate divisions launched their attack on the Federal lines and officially initiated the Battle of Atlanta.", "direction_notes": "", "description": "<p>Shortly after noon on July 22, 1864, the Battle of Atlanta began in the vicinity of the present day campus of Alonzo Crim High School at Memorial Drive and Clifton Street.&nbsp; Confederate divisions commanded by Brigadier General Hugh Mercer (who replaced the fallen William H.

McPherson as commander of the Army of the Tennessee, was alerted to the dire threat to the Army.&nbsp; Logan gathered reinforcements and galloped on his black stallion Slasher toward the collapsed front of the Federal 15<sup>th</sup> Army Crops.&nbsp; When Logan arrived on the scene, three Federal Division commanders were already preparing a counterattack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black Jack&rdquo; Logan, whose dark complexion and jet-black hair and moustache made him a striking physical presence on the battlefield, was renown for his inspirational combat leadership. &nbsp;He personally led the advancing Union infantry, supported by artillery fire, in a counterstrike that hurled back the Confederates, recaptured the DeGress Battery, and restored the 15<sup>th</sup> Corps line that had been lost earlier in the afternoon. &nbsp;The Federal troops did not pursue their retreating foes, and fighting in the vicinity of the Troup Hurt house came to a close. Combat continued until dark at Leggett&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Logan&rsquo;s outstanding combat performance in the Battle of Atlanta added to his already lustrous reputation, and he emerged from the Civil War a Northern military hero.&nbsp; Military historian Albert Castel credits Logan more than any other individual for the Union victory on July 22, 1864, citing &ldquo;his skillful handling of his troops, his coolness and determination, and above all his inspiring presence.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Logan was among the most accomplished of the &ldquo;political&rdquo; generals, a group of politically appointed U.S. Army officers who eagerly volunteered for Civil War service, had little or no military training, and typically had limited if any success in combat.&nbsp; This system of appointment meant the North&rsquo;s pool of military talent was diluted compared to the South&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Logan was an exception and was praised by Sherman as &ldquo;perfect in combat.&rdquo; &nbsp;Still, Logan&rsquo;s lack of West Point credentials deterred Sherman from promoting Logan to permanent command of the Army of the Tennessee, an oversight that infuriated Logan.&nbsp; Instead, Sherman appointed West Point graduate Oliver Otis Howard five days after the Battle of Atlanta.</p>\r\n<p>Before the war, Logan had served as a highly partisan Democratic member of Congress from southern Illinois, and in 1866 he returned to politics as a Radical Republican, serving either in the House or Senate almost without interruption until his unexpected death in 1886.&nbsp; In 1884, he was the unsuccessful nominee for Vice President on the Republican ticket headed by James G. Blaine.&nbsp; He also co-founded the largest Union veterans group, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), and served three times as the GAR&rsquo;s commander in chief.&nbsp; On May 5, 1868, shortly after his first term began, Logan issued a general order to all GAR posts that established Decoration Day as the Northern counterpart to the previously established Confederate Memorial Days.&nbsp; He designated May 30 as the day for all Union veterans to decorate the graves of comrades &ldquo;who died in defense of their country in the late rebellion.&rdquo;&nbsp; On May 30, 1868, commemorative ceremonies were attended by thousands of people in 27 states.</p>\r\n<p>During the 1870s, Northerners and Southerners began to participate together in Memorial Day celebrations, which increasingly served the purpose of sectional reconciliation. &nbsp;The national ritual was known as Decoration Day, and the Southern versions--which were observed on different days in different states--were called Confederate Memorial Day. &nbsp;In the 1880s, the GAR actively campaigned to change the name of Decoration Day to Memorial Day, and gradually every northern state made Memorial Day a public holiday.&nbsp; The Memorial Day service in Chicago on May 30, 1895 was a high point in the celebration of sectional reconciliation.&nbsp; On that day, a monument to Confederate dead was dedicated in the city&rsquo;s Oak Wood Cemetery, the burial site of over 6,000 Confederate soldiers who had died as prisoners-of-war at nearby Camp Douglas.&nbsp; Approximately 50,000 Chicagoans lined the parade route to the cemetery to catch a glimpse of such notables as Confederate general James Longstreet and Union general John Schofield.&nbsp; In the twentieth century, Memorial Day became an occasion to honor all American veterans who died in service.&nbsp; In 1968, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as the last Monday in May.</p>\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n<p>Castel A. &ldquo;Black Jack&rdquo; Logan.&nbsp; Civil War time Illustrated.&nbsp; 1976; 15(7):4-10, 41-45.</p>\r\n<p>Jones JP.

McPherson&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee with a surprise attack and capture or destroy McPherson&rsquo;s supply wagons parked in the Decatur town square. The left end of McPherson&rsquo;s line, entrenched along Bald Hill (Leggett&rsquo;s Hill) and to the south of it, was a particularly vulnerable weak spot that Hood sought to exploit.</p>\r\n<p>He sent William Hardee&rsquo;s infantry Corps, accompanied by Joseph Wheeler&rsquo;s cavalry, from behind the walled fortifications on Atlanta&rsquo;s south side on a 15-mile march on the night of July 21st, with the goal of attacking the Yankees at daybreak on July 22nd.&nbsp; Hardee&rsquo;s mission was to rout the Federal left wing that was aligned along the ridge that is present day Moreland Avenue.&nbsp; Union infantry and artillery faced Atlanta to the west.&nbsp; Wheeler&rsquo;s assignment was to overtake the supply wagons in Decatur, six miles east of Atlanta. When Hardee pounced, Cheatham&rsquo;s Corps would move from behind the walled fortifications on Atlanta east&rsquo;s side against the center of the Federal line held by McPherson and Schofield&rsquo;s troops. However, Hardee&rsquo;s four infantry Divisions moved slowly along back roads south and east of the city on an oppressively hot July night, and two of his Divisions were further delayed by a large mill pond and off-road thickets and marshes. As a result, Hardee&rsquo;s attack did not start until shortly before noon on July 22nd, and instead of catching the Yankee&rsquo;s off guard, the Confederates charged against a Federal left wing that had been re-configured that morning and was well positioned to fend off the opening assault of the Battle of Atlanta.</p>\r\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"http://dev.emorydisc.org/battleofatlanta/tour/battle-of-atlanta/media/145/\"><img src=\"http://dev.emorydisc.org/battleofatlanta/media/tour_stops/hardees-night-march/inline/hardee-division-commanders.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></a><span class=\"caption\">caption</span></p>\r\n<p>Most of Hardee&rsquo;s Night March was along roads that still exist. The present day thoroughfares are wider and paved with asphalt, but many directly overlie their narrow, dirt road predecessors from the Civil War era. A driving tour that closely emulates the 15-mile night march provides an appreciation of the long, circuitous route and remote territory over which 17,000 -18,000 Confederate foot and horse soldiers trekked. Local historian Wilbur Kurtz&rsquo;s meticulously researched accounts of the march, his detailed maps, and the Georgia Historical Commission markers he wrote in the 1950s inform the recommended tour route and the location of the landmarks described below. The driving tour is comprised of four segments.</p>\r\n<h4>(1) Leaving Atlanta and Moving South of the City</h4>\r\n<p>Wheeler&rsquo;s cavalry and Hardee&rsquo;s infantry left Atlanta at nightfall and headed due south toward the South River, a city river that begins near the present day Atlanta airport and enters Lake Jackson, approximately 45 miles to the southeast. The troops exited the city&rsquo;s walled fortifications along old McDonough Road (present day Capitol Avenue and Hank Aaron Drive).</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?path=color:0x0000ff%7C33.730209,-84.368327%7C33.713817,-84.368638%7C33.712693,-84.365312%7C33.70948,-84.360291%7C33.706517,-84.3569%7C33.705214,-84.355248%7C33.7045,-84.353038%7C33.704428,-84.349519%7C33.695449,-84.34954&amp;size=290x190&amp;sensor=false&amp;key=AIzaSyBx6Zz6NMBoTBzIU0sbZQezxXgFMZdKZeI\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Begin the driving tour of Hardee&rsquo;s Night March&nbsp;at the intersection of Boulevard and Atlanta Avenue,</span> the site of Fort Walker.</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Drive south on Boulevard</span> until it ends at present day McDonough Boulevard (Old McDonough Road).</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Turn left on to McDonough Boulevard.</span> Wheeler&rsquo;s cavalry and Hardee&rsquo;s infantry continued on the old McDonough Road as it bent in a southeasterly direction at this point.</li>\r\n<li>Pass the large U.S. federal prison on the right and <span class=\"directions\">continue southeast toward Moreland Avenue.</span></li>\r\n<li>A Georgia Historical Marker describing Hardee&rsquo;s Night March is located on the south side of McDonough Road, 100 yards west of Moreland Avenue.</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Turn right on to Moreland Avenue</span> (which did not exist in 1864).</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Drive south for 0.6 miles and turn left on Key Road.</span> Although Hardee&rsquo;s march continued further south for over a mile, for the purposes of the driving tour, Key Road is a convenient exit off of Moreland Avenue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>(2) Heading Northeast to the Site of Cobb&rsquo;s Mill</h4>\r\n<p>After reaching its southernmost point, at or near the South River, five or six miles outside Atlanta, Hardee&rsquo;s March shifted direction and moved northeast to Cobb&rsquo;s Mill on Intrenchment Creek, a local landmark that the head of the column reached at dawn on July 22, 1864.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?path=color:0x0000ff%7C33.695449,-84.34954%7C33.695324,-84.342223%7C33.696074,-84.341301%7C33.697091,-84.338576%7C33.697787,-84.336151%7C33.698394,-84.334606%7C33.699537,-84.333297%7C33.701233,-84.332117&amp;size=290x190&amp;sensor=false&amp;key=AIzaSyBx6Zz6NMBoTBzIU0sbZQezxXgFMZdKZeI\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">Continue eastward on Key Road and turn left at the fork (heading northeast).</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"directions\">At a small bridge, Key Road crosses Intrenchment Creek.</span> In 1864, this was Old Fayetteville Road and William Cobb&rsquo;s Mill was located here at the creek.</li>\r\n<li>Two Georgia Historical Markers, describing Cobb&rsquo;s Mill and Cobb&rsquo;s House, are located just north of the creek and west of Key Road, near the entrance to a Water Reclamation Center and an Atlanta Police Academy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>(3) At Intrenchment Creek</h4>\r\n<p>Hardee and his four division commanders met Cobb at his house north of the creek at daybreak or shortly thereafter on July 22.&nbsp;

Cleburne&rsquo;s Division of Hardee&rsquo;s Corps took advantage of a gap in the Federal line (which Union Major General James B. McPherson had tried to close) and launched the fierce Confederate struggle to retake Leggett&rsquo;s Hill on July 22<sup>nd</sup>.&nbsp; At the conclusion of Hardee&rsquo;s 15-mile night march, the two Divisions on the left of Hardee&rsquo;s Corps, commanded by Cleburne and Brigadier General George Maney, had arrived just south of the hill shortly before noon.&nbsp; Cleburne&rsquo;s Division was deployed on and east of Old Flat Shoals Road (also known as the Old McDonough Road and now known as Flat Shoals Avenue) and Maney&rsquo;s Division was positioned to Cleburne&rsquo;s left, west of the road.&nbsp; Cleburne and Maney&rsquo;s Divisions faced the section of the entrenched Federal line held by Brigadier General Giles A. Smith&rsquo;s Division that bent southeastward from Leggett&rsquo;s Hill along Old Flat Shoals Road, ending at present day Glenwood Avenue.&nbsp; This section comprised the right angle in the &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped Federal line that extended north along present day Moreland Avenue (the vertical segment of the &ldquo;L&rdquo;) and east along present day Glenwood Avenue and Memorial Drive (the horizontal segment of the &ldquo;L&rdquo;).&nbsp; A half-mile gap between Smith&rsquo;s Division of the Federal 17<sup>th</sup> Corps and the 16<sup>th</sup> Corps in Sugar Creek Valley to the east&mdash;a break in the line between the right angle and the horizontal part of the &ldquo;L&rdquo;&mdash;provided an opening that Cleburne&rsquo;s Division could exploit. &nbsp;Cleburne&rsquo;s troops poured through the gap beginning at about 1 p.m. and, in the process, his skirmishers encountered and killed Federal Major General James B. McPherson.&nbsp; Cleburne&rsquo;s Division, later joined by Maney&rsquo;s, pressed forward in a series of costly, brigade-level attacks on entrenched Northern positions. &nbsp;During two hours of intense fighting, the Southerners captured a short portion of the Union line and established themselves in the gap between the Federal 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> Corps.&nbsp; However, the Confederates failed to dislodge the vulnerable portion of the 17<sup>th</sup> Corps line defending Leggett&rsquo;s Hill.</p>\r\n<p>Only late in the afternoon when the Southerners launched a more coordinated attack from multiple directions did they drive Giles A. Smith&rsquo;s Division from its entrenchments along Flat Shoals Road to a new position that compressed the Federal forces on Leggett&rsquo;s Hill and threatened a more serious rupture in the Union line.&nbsp; From his field headquarters near Oakland Cemetery, sometime between 3 and 4 p.m., Confederate Army commander Major General John B. Hood committed Major General Benjamin Franklin Cheatham&rsquo;s Corps to the offensive, sending Cheatham&rsquo;s three Divisions from behind Atlanta&rsquo;s walled fortifications to the battlefield east of the city. These attacks were aimed at the long north-south section line of the Federal Army of Tennessee, along present day Moreland Avenue.&nbsp; Major General Carter L. Stevenson&rsquo;s Confederate Division, on Cheatham&rsquo;s far right, advanced against Leggett&rsquo;s Federal Division defending the hill.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s troops are depicted in the Cyclorama charging eastward across the barren hill top toward Leggett&rsquo;s troops entrenched at the edge of woods on the hill&rsquo;s western slope.&nbsp; Shortly after 6 p.m. the Southern assaults came together in a simultaneous attack in which Cleburne and Stevenson&rsquo;s Division forced all of Smith&rsquo;s Division and part of Leggett&rsquo;s to fall back until the two units were completely intermingled.&nbsp; Despite the confusion, the veteran Northern troops rallied and aided by artillery they repelled the Southerners, forcing their final retreat from Leggett&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; Leggett summed up this phase of the Battle of Atlanta in a post-war speech to a veteran&rsquo;s group: &ldquo;The struggle to recover the hill from us was fierce and desperate beyond description.&nbsp; The carnage at this point was terrible and sickening.&nbsp; The ground from close to our works to one hundred yards or more away was literally covered with dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /> <!--[endif]--></p>\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n<p>Eccleberger G.&nbsp; The Day Dixie Died: The Battle of Atlanta.

Reed bemoaned their failure in his Atlanta Constitution column published in 1900:&nbsp; &ldquo;We have been criminally careless of our history.&nbsp; For generations to come artists and tourists from every part of the world will come here and they will ask a thousand questions about these famous places.&nbsp; Who will answer them?&nbsp; We have about 125,000 people here and only a few hundred are able now to point out the location of the old battlefields.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The next, national wave of Civil War battlefield preservation peaked in the 1920s and 1930s, but by then it was too late to properly save Atlanta&rsquo;s battlefields.&nbsp; Atlanta historian and artist Wilbur G. Kurtz noted in 1931 that &ldquo;Nothing obliterates the aspect of a battlefield so much as the modern steam-shovel and the encroachments of urban building enterprise.&rdquo; &nbsp; A local campaign in 1937 seeking Federal funds to preserve what remained of the city&rsquo;s battlegrounds was unsuccessful, despite renewed enthusiasm for Civil War preservation spurred by the popularity of Margaret Mitchell&rsquo;s Gone with the Wind. &nbsp; In 1951, the Georgia legislature established the Georgia Historical Commission and charged it with preserving, restoring, and marking the state&rsquo;s historic sites.&nbsp; The following year, the commission hired Kurtz to research, write, and place historic markers that pinpoint and explain the notable events of the Atlanta campaign.&nbsp; Kurtz&rsquo;s historic markers were all erected prior to the Civil War centennial, 1961-1965.&nbsp; The inscriptions he wrote for each plaque continue to serve as the primary roadside guide to Atlanta&rsquo;s battlefields. &nbsp; They provide a means of connecting the historical narrative of the Battle of Atlanta to the ground on which the battle was fought, even though most of the terrain has been irrevocably altered.</p>"}}, {"pk": 13, "model": "tour.tourstop", "fields": {"park_lng": -84.327085, "park_lat": 33.740214, "name": "Death of Gen.

Hardee&rsquo;s Corps, which had been engaged since shortly after 12 noon.&nbsp; For the first three hours of the Battle of Atlanta, the Confederates mounted attacks against the far left of the Union line, which was positioned south of the Georgia Railroad, in the vicinity of Leggett&rsquo;s Hill and entrenched along its crest.&nbsp; Hoping to help Hardee&rsquo;s infantry take the hill, Hood&mdash;between 3 and 4 p.m.&mdash;instructed Cheatham&rsquo;s Corps to attack the Federal 17<sup>th</sup> Division, which remained in control of the treeless high ground, and move simultaneously against the Federal 15<sup>th</sup> Division, which had not yet been engaged in the battle and was straddling the Georgia Railroad to the right (north) of the 17<sup>th</sup> Division.&nbsp; Cheatham mobilized his three Divisions from behind Atlanta&rsquo;s walled fortifications, deploying his troops in a battle line that extended for more than a mile, from south of Leggett&rsquo;s Hill to north of the Georgia Railroad. &nbsp; The Division on Cheatham&rsquo;s right, commanded by Major General Carter L. Stevenson, attacked first, moving eastward from behind Confederate fortifications in the vicinity of present day Grant Park and charging against the Federal 17<sup>th</sup> Division defending Leggett&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; Cheatham&rsquo;s other two Divisions, led by Brigadier General John C. Brown&rsquo;s in the middle and Major General Henry D. Clayton&rsquo;s on the left, followed Stevenson&rsquo;s Division into combat.&nbsp; Brown and Clayton&rsquo;s troops marched from behind Atlanta&rsquo;s eastern fortifications, aligned themselves in battle formation in present day Inman Park, and from there attacked Union forces entrenched in a linear formation on either side of the Georgia Railroad.&nbsp; A historical marker placed in a small triangular park at Delta Place and Edgewood Avenue describes the frontal assault that Brown and Clayton&rsquo;s Divisions launched against the Federal 15<sup>th</sup> Division, which was commanded by Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith.&nbsp; The Federal 15<sup>th</sup> Division had been led by Major General John A.

Hardee.&nbsp; Hardee emphasized the importance of placing the majority of combat forces in closely packed lines.&nbsp; The typical battle line for offensive and defensive purposes aligned troops shoulder to shoulder two or three ranks deep.&nbsp; These formations were difficult to maneuver in the field, and their effectiveness depended on prior drilling and battlefield discipline.&nbsp; However, once deployed, linear formations offered the advantage of a high density of firepower delivered with successive volleys as each rank of infantry alternately fired and reloaded or as one rank relieved another if necessary. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In a frontal attack, wave after wave of infantry would strike against a short sector of the enemy&rsquo;s line.&nbsp; A succession of attacks was intended to weaken and eventually break the opposition&rsquo;s line at a vulnerable spot, which immediately endangered the remaining segments of the penetrated line.&nbsp; On defense, the battle line enabled concentrated volleys of fire against attackers, and, by 1864, both Union and Confederate infantry learned to strengthen their lines of defense with extensive use of protective earthworks.&nbsp; Even if attackers got inside an enemy&rsquo;s position, exploiting that advantage was difficult because of heavy losses during the attack, lack of reinforcements, or a counterattack by the defenders.&nbsp; The result was frequent failure of frontal assaults, particularly in the latter stages of the Civil War.&nbsp; Among these failures were the unsuccessful attacks launched by Cheatham&rsquo;s Corps against the Federal Army of the Tennessee in the climactic phase of the Battle of Atlanta.&nbsp; Still, the Confederate Divisions led by Brown and Clayton achieved a notable breakthrough in the Union line before they were turned back in a ferocious counterattack led by Major General John A.
